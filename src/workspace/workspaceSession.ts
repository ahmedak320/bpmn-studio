// Workspace-session guards — the data-safety spine for switching folders and
// refreshing the tree. All logic here is pure (no React / DOM / FS) so it is
// unit-tested directly in plain node (see src/__tests__/workspaceSession.test.ts).
//
// Two distinct hazards this guards, both surfaced by the Codex review:
//
//  * CRITICAL-1 — after the user switches to a different folder, a tab that was
//    opened against the PREVIOUS folder must never write its relative path
//    through the NEW root handle. Every tab records the workspace *generation*
//    it was opened under; a save is committed only while that generation is
//    still the live one (`canCommitToWorkspace`). Switching folders bumps the
//    generation, instantly invalidating every stale tab.
//
//  * MAJOR-8 — two workspace scans (buildTree + scanWorkspaceFiles) launched by
//    overlapping mutations can finish out of order, letting a slow earlier scan
//    overwrite a newer one, or a scan begun before a folder switch commit its
//    results against the new folder. `createRefreshGuard` hands each scan a
//    monotonically increasing token; the scan commits only if it is BOTH the
//    most recent token AND still scanning the currently-active handle.

/**
 * True when a tab opened under `tabGeneration` may still write to disk, i.e. the
 * workspace has not been switched out from under it. A mismatch means a folder
 * switch happened after the tab was opened — the write MUST be refused so it
 * cannot land in the wrong workspace.

/**
 * Run an async `producer`, then `commit` its result ONLY if the workspace
 * generation is unchanged from when the producer started. Models the guard that
 * async file reads (`openDirectoryFile`) and AI placement use so a folder switch
 * mid-flight can never commit stale content into — or write a generated diagram
 * into — the WRONG workspace (Codex ORIG-1). Returns whether it committed.
