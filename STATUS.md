# Status ledger — OrbitPM Process Studio

Append one entry per wave/lane completed.

## Wave A1 scaffold

- electron-vite + React + TypeScript app hand-scaffolded (official
  `@quick-start/electron` CLI is an interactive TUI that would not accept
  piped/non-interactive input in this environment — wrote the standard
  electron-vite layout by hand per plan §3 instead).
- `package.json`: productName "OrbitPM Process Studio", appId
  `ae.orbitpm.processstudio`, version `0.0.1`.
- Main process (`src/main/index.ts`) supports `--smoke-test`: creates the
  `BrowserWindow` with `show: false`, and on `ready-to-show` prints
  `SMOKE_OK` and calls `app.exit(0)` instead of showing the window.
- `electron-builder.yml`: win nsis target, `oneClick: true`,
  `perMachine: false`, `allowElevation: false`, `runAfterFinish: true`,
  `.bpmn` fileAssociations, `publish: { provider: github, owner:
  ahmedak320, repo: bpmn-studio }`.
- `.github/workflows/build.yml`: windows-latest, triggers on `v*` tags and
  `workflow_dispatch`, `npm ci` → `npm run build` → `electron-builder --win
  --publish always` with `GH_TOKEN`; Docker wine fallback documented in
  comments.
- `desktop/` initialized as its own git repo; parent `bpmn_tool/.gitignore`
  updated to ignore `desktop/`.
- Verification (Linux dev env — see task report for exact commands/output):
  `npm install`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, and a headless
  `--smoke-test` run (via `xvfb-run` if available, else `$DISPLAY` reuse, else
  deferred with build+typecheck as the passing bar per plan).

Next: A2 (early installability gate — CI walking-skeleton Setup.exe,
pre-release, Ahmed tries it on the laptop) can proceed in parallel with wave
B once this scaffold is committed.

## Wave A2: early installability gate

- Created public GitHub repo `ahmedak320/bpmn-studio`, pushed the existing
  desktop root commit as `main`.
- CI fix applied before first tag: added `permissions: contents: write` to
  `.github/workflows/build.yml` (default `GITHUB_TOKEN` scope was otherwise
  ambiguous for release creation on a fresh repo).
- First attempt (`v0.0.1-alpha.1`) built and published successfully on
  `windows-latest`, but electron-builder names/tags GitHub releases from
  `package.json`'s `version` field, not the pushed git tag — it created a
  stray `v0.0.1` draft release instead of `v0.0.1-alpha.1`. Fixed by bumping
  `package.json` version to `0.0.1-alpha.2` to match the tag scheme,
  deleted the stray release/tag, retagged `v0.0.1-alpha.2`, pushed — CI went
  green and published a correctly-tagged release on the second attempt (1
  fix, well within the 3-attempt budget).
- Release published (undrafted + marked prerelease):
  **https://github.com/ahmedak320/bpmn-studio/releases/tag/v0.0.1-alpha.2**
  Assets: `OrbitPM-Process-Studio-Setup-0.0.1-alpha.2.exe` (~78 MB),
  `.exe.blockmap`, `latest.yml` (all present, as required for
  electron-updater's GitHub provider).
- Static sanity on the downloaded .exe: `file` confirms
  `PE32 executable (GUI) ... Nullsoft Installer self-extracting archive`;
  `7z l` confirms NSIS-3 Unicode archive with the expected `$PLUGINSDIR`
  payload (`app-64.7z`) and `Uninstall OrbitPM Process Studio.exe`;
  `strings` on the embedded manifest confirms
  `requestedExecutionLevel level="asInvoker"` — i.e. no admin elevation
  requested, consistent with `oneClick: true` / `perMachine: false` /
  `allowElevation: false` in `electron-builder.yml`.
- Fallback path (local Docker `electronuserland/builder:wine`) was **not
  needed** — CI succeeded within budget.

## Wave B (parallel lanes B1–B4)

- **B1 Workspace** (`37dacb5`): root picker (first-run + Settings),
  path-guarded fs IPC (`src/main/workspace`, `WORKSPACE_CHANNELS`:
  getRoot/chooseRoot/listTree/readFile/writeFile/createFolder/
  createBpmnFile/rename/move/delete + `treeChanged` push), atomic
  writes (temp+rename), chokidar-driven tree refresh, `FolderTree` +
  `WorkspacePicker` renderer components. Established the
  no-Electron-import `ipcContract.ts` pattern later lanes reused
  (workspace/openFile/menu/theme/ai contracts).
- **B2 Editor** (`af14980`): `EditorTab` — bpmn-js Modeler + properties
  panel + create-append-anything + minimap, Ctrl+S save, dirty-state
  tracking (`editor/dirty.ts`), SVG/PNG export, call-activity
  double-click hook (`onOpenCalledProcess`), `NEW_DIAGRAM_XML` factory.
- **B3 Pipeline port** (`f84aedc`): `src/gen` — IR Zod schema, validator,
  transformer (+ documented dedup-flow fix), semantic BPMN XML emitter,
  `bpmn-auto-layout@0.4.0` wrapper, prompts, `generateFromDescription`
  with conversational repair loop. Golden-tested against the vendored
  Python transformer's output on all 7 example IRs.
- **B4 Providers + settings** (`9b5573c`): 7-provider catalog
  (`src/main/providers.ts`, `makeCallLLM`), `safeStorage`-backed secrets
  vault (`src/main/secrets.ts`), pure `SettingsModal` UI (delivered
  unwired this wave — wired in Wave C by C1).
- Gate: `npm run typecheck` / `npm run build` / `npm test` green after
  each lane; combined Wave B test count carried into Wave C's baseline.

## Wave C (parallel lanes C1–C3) + C4 integration stitch

- **C1 AI integration** (`d87df64`): `ai:generate`/`ai:testConnection`
  IPC (`src/main/ai/{ai.ts,adapter.ts,ipcContract.ts}`), a B4→B3
  `CallLLM` adapter (`bridgeCallLLM`), Windows-safe slugify
  (`src/shared/slug.ts`), the `AiPanel` renderer UI, and the first real
  `App.tsx` assembly (tabs, save/dirty/confirm-close, AiPanel +
  SettingsModal mounted). Left explicit `TODO(C4)` slots in
  `index.ts`/`preload/index.ts`/`App.tsx`/`env.d.ts` for C2's and C3's
  work, since those two lanes were barred from touching the files C1
  owned this wave.
- **C2 Cross-process linking** (`34fe961`): `src/shared/processIndex.ts`
  (regex-based processId→file index, namespace-prefix agnostic,
  `listUnresolvedCalledElements`), `src/renderer/src/links/**`
  (`useProcessIndex`, `LinkPicker`, `SelectionLinkButton`,
  `setCalledElement` modeling op). Delivered as a standalone,
  fully-tested module tree plus exact integration snippets in its report
  (C2.md) — not wired into `App.tsx`/`EditorTab.tsx` by C2 itself, per
  this wave's file-ownership rules.
- **C3 Windows polish** (`1883a2d`): `src/main/updater.ts`
  (electron-updater GitHub-provider wiring, background + interactive
  check flows, never sets `verifyUpdateCodeSignature`/`publisherName`),
  `src/main/menu.ts` (File/View/Help native menu), `src/main/openFile.ts`
  (`.bpmn` file-association open-path resolution: inside/outside/no-root
  classification + import-copy flow), `src/main/themeContract.ts` +
  `src/renderer/src/theme.ts` (`nativeTheme` dark-mode wiring), real app
  icon (`resources/icon.{svg,png,ico}`) wired into
  `electron-builder.yml`. Also delivered as a standalone module tree +
  exact `index.ts`/`preload.ts` snippets, not wired in by C3 itself.
- **C4 integration stitch (this entry)**: applied C2's and C3's
  documented patch snippets into the three C4-owned files
  (`src/main/index.ts`, `src/preload/index.ts`,
  `src/renderer/src/App.tsx`) plus a toolbar-stitch patch to
  `src/renderer/src/editor/EditorTab.tsx`:
  - `index.ts`: wired `THEME_CHANNELS.get` IPC, `initAutoUpdater()`,
    `Menu.setApplicationMenu(buildMenu(...))`, first-launch
    `did-finish-load` open-path handling, and `second-instance` argv
    forwarding for `.bpmn` double-click opens.
  - `preload/index.ts`: added the `openFile`/`theme`/`menu` namespaces
    alongside the existing `workspace`/`settings`/`ai`/`providers` ones;
    `src/renderer/env.d.ts` extended to match.
  - `App.tsx`: wired `useProcessIndex` + a real call-activity
    drill-down handler (resolves `calledElement` → file via the process
    index, `window.alert` fallback for unresolved links — no toast
    infra exists yet, matches C2's documented placeholder copy),
    subscribed to `openFile.onOpenFile` (file-association opens) and
    `menu.onAction` (File-menu Save/Export/New Process/Open Workspace
    Folder), and added an unresolved-call-activity-links badge to the
    status bar (footer), computed against the active tab's loaded XML.
  - `EditorTab.tsx` (toolbar-stitch only): added `onModelerReady` (so a
    parent can read the live modeler for `SelectionLinkButton`),
    `onCommandsReady` (a small typed command bus — each mounted tab
    reports `{save, exportSvg, exportPng}`; `App.tsx` looks up whichever
    entry belongs to the active tab for the native File-menu's
    Save/Export items instead of a broadcast event), and `toolbarExtra`
    (an opaque `ReactNode` slot at the end of the toolbar, used to mount
    `SelectionLinkButton` only for the active tab).
  - **Bug found + fixed during smoke testing** (not present in any lane's
    report): `src/main/updater.ts`'s `import { autoUpdater } from
    'electron-updater'` type-checked and unit-tested fine but crashed the
    *built* app at runtime — `SyntaxError: Named export 'autoUpdater' not
    found` (electron-vite externalizes `node_modules` for the main
    process; Node's `cjs-module-lexer` doesn't statically detect this
    package's named export). A plain default-import fix would have broken
    `tests/unit/menu.test.ts`'s existing `vi.mock('electron-updater', ...)`
    (which returns a named `autoUpdater` export with no `default`). Fixed
    with a namespace import + dual-shape resolver
    (`electronUpdaterExports.autoUpdater ??
    electronUpdaterExports.default?.autoUpdater`) that satisfies both the
    real Node ESM/CJS interop shape and the test mock shape.
- Gates (final, on the fully-stitched tree): `npm run typecheck` clean,
  `npm run build` clean (main 78.9 kB / preload 4.86 kB / renderer
  3.18 MB — bpmn-js + AI SDK providers are the bulk), `npm test` → **24
  test files / 196 tests, all green**. `--smoke-test` run
  (`DISPLAY=:0 npx electron ./out/main/index.js --smoke-test
  --no-sandbox`) prints `SMOKE_OK` and exits 0. A 15s untouched
  interactive launch (`--no-sandbox`, no `--smoke-test`) produced zero
  stdout/stderr output — no runtime errors during startup. No screenshot
  tool was available in this environment (`scrot`/`import`/`spectacle`/
  `gnome-screenshot` all absent) — skipped per instructions rather than
  installing one unprompted.
- Committed: `stitch: wire linking, polish, theme; full app assembly`.
  Pushed `main` to `origin` (this lane's responsibility per the wave
  plan — no earlier Wave B/C lane pushed).

**Wave C complete: AI generation, cross-process linking, and Windows
polish (updater/menu/file-association/dark-mode/icon) are all wired end
to end in a single assembled app. Remaining gaps are listed in this
lane's report for Wave D.**

## Wave D — lane D2 (docs + v0.1.0 pre-release)

Running in parallel with D1 (playwright-electron e2e suite, `tests/e2e`),
which owns its own file tree and isn't touched by this entry.

- **README.md**: full user-first rewrite — what the app is, install
  (download `Setup.exe` from Releases, SmartScreen "More info → Run
  anyway", per-user/no-admin install), first run (workspace-root picker,
  OneDrive folder recommended), using it (folder tree, drawing basics,
  save/export, call-activity linking + drill-down + the unresolved-links
  footer badge), AI setup (Settings gear → per-provider field table for
  all 7 providers incl. Moonshot/Kimi and GLM's OpenAI-compatible base
  URL + model fields and Azure's 4-field deployment-driven config, keys
  stored via `safeStorage`/DPAPI and never leaving the workspace),
  offline/online feature matrix, "files are standard BPMN 2.0" portability
  note, troubleshooting table (SmartScreen, corporate proxy — system
  proxy is used automatically, OneDrive lock hiccups, `ai.log` location,
  where keys/settings live), dev section (npm ci/dev/build/test, smoke
  test, e2e pointer, release process with the version==tag rule spelled
  out explicitly).
- **package.json**: bumped `version` from `0.0.1-alpha.2` to `0.1.0`
  (direct edit — no dependency changes, so the `.npm-lock` install
  protocol doesn't apply here).
- **Release v0.1.0**: tagged and pushed after `typecheck`/`build`/`test`
  gates passed locally; CI (`.github/workflows/build.yml`, unchanged —
  still green from A2/C4) built on `windows-latest` and published the
  GitHub Release. See this lane's report (`D2.md`) for the exact CI run
  URL, asset list, and static installer checks performed on the
  downloaded `.exe`.

**Wave D (D2 scope) status: README complete, v0.1.0 tagged/released.
Findings/URLs in the D2 lane report; D1's e2e results are tracked
separately in that lane's own report.**

## Wave R — lane R1 (release repair: v0.1.0 → v0.1.1)

`v0.1.0` (=`0db4ff2`) was built and released **before**
`169d6b1` ("e2e: playwright-electron suite with fake-LLM hook") landed
on `main`. That commit — besides adding the playwright-electron e2e
suite — contains three ship-blocking app fixes that were only
discovered by actually running the built app:

1. **Preload must be CommonJS** (`out/preload/index.cjs`). The
   released `v0.1.0` build's preload was `.mjs`, which fails to load
   under `sandbox:true`, leaving `window.orbitpm` `undefined` and the
   app hanging forever on "Loading workspace…". **v0.1.0 was DOA** —
   nobody could get past the loading screen.
2. `EditorTab` was missing `CreateAppendElementTemplatesModule`,
   which crashed on every diagram open.
3. A process-index root race in `App.tsx`.

Because `v0.1.0` cannot be used at all, it was pulled rather than
patched forward:

- `git push` — landed `169d6b1` on `origin/main` (was local-only,
  1 commit ahead).
- `gh release delete v0.1.0 --yes` — removed the GitHub Release (and
  its assets) so nobody downloads the broken installer.
- `git push --delete origin v0.1.0` + `git tag -d v0.1.0` — removed
  the tag locally and on `origin`.
- Bumped `package.json` version `0.1.0` → `0.1.1` (no dependency
  changes; `.npm-lock` protocol used per convention anyway).
- Quick gates re-run against the fixed commit before tagging:
  `npm run typecheck` (clean), `npm run build` (confirms
  `out/preload/index.cjs` — CommonJS, the fix — is what's emitted),
  `npm test` — **196/196 passed**.
- Committed `release: v0.1.1 (supersedes v0.1.0 — includes
  e2e-discovered runtime fixes)`, pushed `main`, tagged `v0.1.1`,
  pushed the tag. CI (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) builds on
  `windows-latest` and publishes the GitHub Release automatically off
  the tag push.
- See this lane's report (`R1.md`) for the CI run URL, the
  `gh release view` asset/flag confirmation (Setup exe, `latest.yml`,
  blockmap), the static NSIS/`asInvoker` checks on the downloaded
  installer, and the `latest.yml` version confirmation.

**`v0.1.1` is an INTERNAL release only** — it supersedes the DOA
`v0.1.0` and unblocks e2e/CI, but a further planned `v0.1.2` (after
the `window.prompt`-in-Electron CRUD-flow issue flagged by the e2e
lane as UNCONFIRMED-in-real-Electron is investigated/fixed) is what
should actually be handed to the end user for install.

## Wave F — lanes F1/F2 (confirmed-findings fixes) + F3 (docs/licensing + v0.1.2 release)

- **F1** (`b3920a6`, E1-1/E2-1): replaced `window.prompt` (unimplemented in
  Electron's `BrowserWindow`, silently returns `null`) with a real in-app
  modal (`src/renderer/src/common/{TextInputModal,PromptProvider}.tsx`,
  `usePromptText`). New Process / New Folder / Rename in the folder tree —
  and File → New Process, which previously just opened the AI panel — now
  actually work in the packaged app. e2e's `window.prompt` stub removed and
  replaced with a real modal-driving flow; added a regression spec
  (`tests/e2e/prompt-modal.spec.ts`) that fails on any resurfaced
  `prompt() is not supported` page error.
- **F2** (`bf97c17`, E1-2/3/5/6/7): CSP `font-src 'self' data:` (bpmn-js's
  icon font was silently blocked, breaking palette/context-pad/
  properties-panel icons); `secrets.getKeys` now returns only
  `{configured, last4}` — provider key fields are write-only in Settings
  (empty by default, `Configured (****last4)` placeholder when a key is
  stored, blank-and-save never clobbers an existing key, "Show" reveal
  control removed); `setWindowOpenHandler`/`will-navigate`/`will-redirect`
  hardened to deny all non-http(s) external navigation and block
  in-app navigation away from the app's own origin; secrets vault file
  written with mode `0o600`; XML emitter strips XML-1.0-illegal control
  characters before escaping (regression test added). Gate at landing:
  typecheck/build clean, `npm test` 200/200 (was 196 — added
  xml-control-chars + vault-mode tests), `npm run test:e2e` 7/7.
- **F3 (this entry) — docs/licensing + the v0.1.2 release**:
  - **E2-2** (README `ai.log` path): corrected the invented
    `<install-folder-data>\logs\ai.log` token to the real
    `%APPDATA%\OrbitPM Process Studio\logs\ai.log`. Also updated the
    AI-setup section to describe F2's write-only key fields
    (`Configured (****last4)` placeholder, no reveal control) and the
    "Folders = organization" section to mention F1's in-app rename/create
    dialogs (replacing the old browser-`prompt()` framing that was never
    accurate for the packaged app).
  - **E2-3** (licensing): added a top-level `LICENSE` (MIT, copyright
    "2026 Ahmed Alkatheeri") and a `"license": "MIT"` field in
    `package.json`. **MIT was chosen as a reasonable default for a public
    repo** — permissive, standard, and trivial for Ahmed to swap for a
    different license later (single file + one `package.json` field, no
    code depends on it). Added a README **Acknowledgements** section
    crediting bpmn.io/bpmn-js (used under the bpmn.io license; the
    "Powered by bpmn.io" watermark is retained, unmodified, per E2's
    licensing review), Electron, the Vercel AI SDK, and
    `bpmn-auto-layout`.
  - **E2-4** (plan.md DoD): ticked `plan.md` §6 boxes 1–3 (Vitest goldens,
    Playwright-electron suite, CI-produces-installer) with one-line
    evidence pointers into this ledger and the live test run this lane
    performed. Boxes 4 (Ahmed's laptop, wave G) and 5's "project memory
    updated" tail are left unticked — legitimately still pending a human
    gate this lane can't perform.
  - **Full gate re-run at HEAD before release** (this lane, live):
    `npm run typecheck` clean; `npm run build` clean; `npm test` →
    **25 files / 200 tests, all green**; `npm run test:e2e`
    (`DISPLAY=:0`) → **8/8 passed** (workspace, editor, ai-generate,
    linking ×2 specs, prompt-modal, settings, boot-and-first-run).
  - **Tracked maintenance item (not fixed this wave)**: Electron is
    pinned at `^33.3.1` (installed `33.4.11`); `npm outdated` shows
    latest is `43.2.0` — ten majors behind. Left as-is deliberately (a
    major Electron bump is a real compatibility/regression risk, out of
    scope for a docs/licensing/release lane); flagging here as a
    tracked-not-forgotten maintenance item for a future wave.
  - **Release v0.1.2**: bumped `package.json` version `0.1.1` → `0.1.2`
    (no dependency changes). This is the first release intended for
    actual end-user install — tagged, pushed, built by CI on
    `windows-latest`, and published **not as a prerelease** (unlike
    `v0.0.1-alpha.2` and `v0.1.1`, which stay marked prerelease) so
    electron-updater's GitHub-provider auto-update treats it as the
    current stable release. See this lane's report (`F3.md`) for the CI
    run URL, asset list, static NSIS/`asInvoker` checks, and
    `latest.yml` version confirmation.

**Wave F status: all E1/E2 findings routed to this wave are resolved (F1
window.prompt fix, F2 CSP/secrets/nav/XML hardening, F3 docs/licensing) or
explicitly tracked as deferred maintenance (Electron major upgrade).
`v0.1.2` is the first non-prerelease, end-user-installable release.**

## 2026-07-22 — Cross-check: desktop pipeline → SpiffArena import ✅
- Desktop gen pipeline (validate→transform→xml→layout, no LLM, nested-exclusive fixture) produced a 5.6KB BPMN+DI file; imported into the running SpiffArena via the bridge → model created, byte-identical on disk, git-committed, and **accepted by SpiffArena's own BPMN parser** (`bpmn_process_ids: ['Process_1']`). Zero incompatibilities. Test model deleted; fixture restored. Closes the interop DoD item — remaining boxes are all wave-G laptop items (install, live keys, auto-update proof).

## 2026-07-22 — Wave G gate result: UNSIGNED INSTALLER BLOCKED on target laptop ❌
- Ahmed's laptop: SmartScreen bypass worked ("Run anyway") but corporate application control then blocked execution ("Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file" + "blocked by your company, request support" dialog) — AppLocker/WDAC or enterprise SmartScreen. Risk #1 materialized in its strong form.
- Claude Desktop precedent reinterpreted: per-user installs are fine, but the policy gates on PUBLISHER SIGNATURE/reputation — unsigned exes are blocked regardless.
- Viable legitimate routes: (1) IT approval request (block dialog offers it); (2) Azure Trusted Signing (~$10/mo) so builds carry a stable publisher identity — also makes IT approval durable across auto-updates (publisher rule, not per-hash); (3) browser-delivered fallbacks (single-file editor / future web version) which app-control does not gate. NO policy-evasion workarounds will be attempted.

## 2026-07-22 — Wave G2 lane L1: portable-exe experiment

- **Framing**: this is a *test of whether packaging form matters* to the
  Wave G corporate-app-control block, run openly on the same laptop — not
  a workaround. Expected result going in: an unsigned portable exe should
  hit the same publisher-reputation gate as the unsigned NSIS installer.
  Either outcome (blocked identically, or something more specific like
  "runs but flags differently") is useful data for deciding between IT
  approval, Azure Trusted Signing, or the browser-delivered fallback (L2,
  this wave).
- Added `.github/workflows/portable-experiment.yml` — `workflow_dispatch`
  only (never runs on tag pushes), `windows-latest`, `permissions:
  contents: write`. Deliberately does **not** touch the committed
  `electron-builder.yml` or `package.json`: it generates a throwaway
  `electron-builder.portable.yml` at runtime (same appId/icon/files, `win
  .target` swapped to `portable`, nsis block dropped) and builds against
  that, so the real NSIS release pipeline config stays byte-for-byte
  untouched. Uploads the resulting exe as a workflow artifact
  (`--publish never`, no release side-effect from the build step itself).
- CI run `29941270325` on `main` (commit `630d268`) went green on the
  first attempt (`build-portable` job, ~2m49s) — no retry needed.
- Downloaded the artifact (`gh run download`) and verified statically:
  `file` → `PE32 executable (GUI) ... Nullsoft Installer self-extracting
  archive`; `7z l` → NSIS-3 Unicode, single `$PLUGINSDIR/app-64.7z`
  payload (electron-builder's portable target is still NSIS-based — a
  self-extracting single exe, not a true zero-extraction PE, but there is
  no separate install step: it unpacks to a temp dir and runs); `strings`
  on the embedded manifest confirms `requestedExecutionLevel
  level="asInvoker" uiAccess="false"` — same no-admin posture as the
  regular installer.
- Renamed to `OrbitPM-Process-Studio-Portable-0.1.2.exe` and attached to
  the **existing** `v0.1.2` release via `gh release upload` (no retag, no
  change to the other three assets — `latest.yml` and the NSIS
  Setup.exe/.blockmap pair are untouched, confirmed via `gh release
  view`).
- **Download URL for the laptop test**:
  https://github.com/ahmedak320/bpmn-studio/releases/download/v0.1.2/OrbitPM-Process-Studio-Portable-0.1.2.exe
- **Instructions for Ahmed** (test openly — if the same "blocked by your
  company, request support" dialog appears, that confirms the block is
  publisher-based, not installer-form-based, and IT approval / Azure
  Trusted Signing remain the real paths forward):
  1. Download `OrbitPM-Process-Studio-Portable-0.1.2.exe` from the link
     above (it will land in `Downloads`, same as the Setup.exe before it).
  2. Run it directly from `Downloads` — no install step, it launches (or
     attempts to launch) the app directly.
  3. Note the *exact* error text if blocked (screenshot or copy-paste is
     ideal) — same corporate app-control dialog as before, a different
     message, or a silent failure are all distinct, useful signals.

## 2026-07-22 — Wave G2 lane L2: OrbitPM Process Studio Lite (zero-install web editor)

- **What it is**: a standalone Vite + React + TS subproject in `lite/` whose
  build emits ONE self-contained `dist/index.html` (via
  `vite-plugin-singlefile`; JS, CSS, and the bpmn.io icon fonts all inlined as
  `data:` — zero external requests at load, only the user's own AI calls go
  out). App-control gates executables, not web pages, so this sidesteps the
  Wave G block entirely.
- **Reuse (not reinvented)**: imports the desktop app's pure code straight from
  `../src` via the `@app/*` Vite alias + tsconfig paths — `src/gen/**` (the
  whole IR→validate→transform→xml→layout→generateFromDescription pipeline,
  incl. `bpmn-auto-layout`), `src/shared/{processIndex,slug}.ts`, and the
  browser-safe renderer helpers `editor/{dirty,callActivity,exportImage,
  newDiagram}`, `editor/EditorTab.css`, `links/{LinkPicker,modelerOps}`, and
  `common/{PromptProvider,TextInputModal}`. Only two React shells that touch
  bpmn-js — `EditorTab` and `SelectionLinkButton` — are *ported* into
  `lite/src` (they still reuse all the pure helpers + CSS above); porting was
  required because (a) bpmn-js's nested `bpmn-moddle@10` named export only
  resolves when the import originates from `lite/src`, and (b) both desktop
  files carry latent type annotations (a canvas cast, an incompatible
  interface-`extends`) that a real `tsc` surfaces — see the deviations note.
- **New (lite-only)**: `fs/fsAccess.ts` — the File System Access API adapter
  (recursive `.bpmn` tree, read/write via handles, create/rename/delete,
  slug dedup) written pure so it's unit-testable with mock handles;
  `fs/idb.ts` (persist the directory handle) + `fs/workspaceHandle.ts`
  (pick / remember / re-request permission, with the single-file fallback when
  `showDirectoryPicker` is unavailable); `ai/browserAi.ts` (browser-direct
  `generateObject` through the SAME `generateFromDescription`, Anthropic via
  the `anthropic-dangerous-direct-browser-access` header + Gemini);
  `ai/keys.ts` (localStorage keys with the unencrypted-storage warning); and
  the 3-zone `App.tsx` (folder tree · tabbed bpmn-js editor + props panel +
  minimap · collapsible AI panel), settings dialog, and picker/tree/AI
  components.
- **Graceful degradation**: full folder mode on Edge/Chrome; automatic
  single-file open + download-on-save fallback (with an explanatory banner) on
  browsers without the File System Access API.
- **AI CORS reality**: only Anthropic + Gemini are reachable from a browser;
  the panel + README state plainly that OpenAI/Kimi/DeepSeek/Azure/GLM need the
  desktop app (or a future web backend).
- **Verification (all green, live this lane)**:
  - `lite` unit tests: **18/18** (`vitest` — the FS-adapter glue with mocked
    handles: tree build, read/write round-trip, create/rename/delete, dedup,
    flatten-for-index).
  - `lite` typecheck: `tsc --noEmit` **clean** (over lite + every reused
    `../src` file it pulls in).
  - `lite` build: one `dist/index.html`, **2.81 MB** (fonts inlined; within the
    2–5 MB target); verified `dist/` contains exactly one file and no
    non-`data:` `url()`/`<script src>`/`<link href>`.
  - **E2E** (`playwright` chromium, **headed** `DISPLAY=:0`, loads the BUILT
    file over `file://`): **2/2** — page renders, forced single-file fallback →
    New blank diagram → bpmn-js canvas shows shapes (start-event circle) →
    Export SVG yields real SVG content; **request interception asserts ZERO
    network/sub-resource requests at load** (proves self-containment); second
    spec asserts the browser-only provider note. FS-picker flows can't be
    automated (native dialog) — covered the fallback path per the plan.
  - **CI-build simulation**: rebuilt in an isolated tree with **no parent
    `node_modules`** (only `lite/ npm ci`) → **byte-identical** artifact,
    proving the Pages workflow resolves the `../src` reuse to `lite/node_modules`
    via Vite `dedupe`.
  - **Parent gates unaffected**: `npm run typecheck` clean, `npm run build`
    clean, `npm test` **200/200** (back to baseline after excluding `lite/**`
    from the root `vitest.config.ts`).
- **Delivery**:
  - `.github/workflows/pages.yml` (new) — on push to `main` touching `lite/**`,
    `npm ci && npm run build` in `lite/`, then `upload-pages-artifact` +
    `deploy-pages` (`permissions: pages: write, id-token: write`).
  - GitHub Pages enabled via `gh api` (`build_type=workflow`).
  - **Live page**: <https://ahmedak320.github.io/bpmn-studio/>
  - **Release asset**: `OrbitPM-Process-Studio-Lite.html` attached to the
    existing `v0.1.2` release (renamed copy of `dist/index.html`; the other
    v0.1.2 assets — NSIS Setup.exe/.blockmap, latest.yml, and L1's Portable
    exe — untouched).
  - README **Lite** section (what it is, the two ways to get it, offline
    matrix, the AI provider-support table, the localStorage key warning) +
    a Development → Lite subsection.
- **Deviation (flagged)**: touched one shared file outside this lane's stated
  ownership — added `'lite/**'` to the root `vitest.config.ts` `exclude` (one
  line). Without it the desktop `npm test` gate collects lite's vitest + throws
  on lite's Playwright spec. This is the minimal change that keeps the parent
  gate green (a wave rule), and is disjoint from L1's files. Did NOT edit the
  reused desktop renderer files (ported the two problematic shells into
  `lite/` instead) to keep all other changes inside `lite/**`.
- **Instructions for Ahmed (laptop)**: open
  <https://ahmedak320.github.io/bpmn-studio/> in **Edge** → click **Open a
  folder…** → pick a OneDrive folder → draw / organize / link; **Ctrl+S**
  saves in place. AI: **Settings → paste an Anthropic or Gemini key** (note the
  unencrypted-storage warning), then **Generate**. Offline-only machine or a
  browser that blocks folders → it drops to single-file open + download-on-save
  automatically. Alternatively download `OrbitPM-Process-Studio-Lite.html` from
  the v0.1.2 release and double-click it — same app, one file, keep it in
  OneDrive.
